  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Lasagna is a classic Italian baked pasta dish characterized by layers of
    wide, flat pasta sheets interspersed with various fillings and sauces. It
    typically includes meat, cheese, and tomato or white sauce, though
    variations exist with vegetables or other additions. The dish is assembled
    in layers and baked until golden and bubbly.
